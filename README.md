# ApolloTwitterAPI
This program allows users with access to twitter's API to push out updates, in the form of tweets, regarding SC-13D files involving the investment company Apollo Global Management.

It makes use of the sec-api package's QueryAPI class, which was designed to be use with the SEC.gov website. In order to use this program, twitter API keys, access tokens, and bearer token are required, and can be obtained by applying for a twitter development account; the free version of the twitter API (as of June 30th, 2023) works with the program. 

A separate API key for sec_api is required and will need to be generated; generating a key is free as of June 30th, 2023.
